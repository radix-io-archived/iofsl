 *   i.e.
 *
 *   class MySingleton : public Singleton<MySingleton>
 *   {
 *     ...
 *
 *   This injects a static 'instance()' method in the class which can
 *   be used to obtain a reference to the singleton instance.
 *   
 *   Note: Singleton is threadsafe.

 *   @TODO Add valgrind ignore macro for memory allocated here.
